# Morse_Code_Unlocking_system
Created a method of unlocking a system using eye blinks to decipher morse code. 
Employed a classification model to separate the eyeblinks and discover patterns, using convolutional neural nets.
Eyeblinks were successfully used to decode Morse code, and the code was then used to unlock a gadget. 
The outcomes were quite effective, and as computer vision is a developing field, there is always need for more research.
